I wanted to create 4 E2e test cases, but it took a couple hours more than I expected, so my wife told me to leave it as it is and just send.
There are 3 requests, the last one receives 401. I got 200 in postman, but there are billions requests probably needed to get 200. 
For the basics I envision that's enough.
Cheers, I go back to my paid vacation ;)
